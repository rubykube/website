<p> Cryptocurrency exchanges are websites where you can buy, sell or exchange cryptocurrencies for other digital currency or traditional currency like US dollars or Euro. <sup class="note"><a href="#notes">1</a></sup> Cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and they will define the future of the financial services and securities industry.  ryptocurrency exchanges enable customers to trade cryptocurrencies or digital
currencies for other assets, such as conventional fiat money, or different digital currencies. <sup class="note"><a href="#notes">2</a></sup><br><br>

The number of cryptocurrencies and exchange platforms are increasing each year. Currently, there are 190 exchanges, compared to 70 exchanges three years ago, on 15 March 2015. Demand to buy and sell is also growing as the number of cryptocurrencies and trading platforms increase. According to blockchain.info, on March 22, 2016, the amount of cryptocurrency traded on major blockchain
exchanges was US$21.4 million. <sup class="note"><a href="#notes">3</a></sup> <br><br>

One of the key issues of the current blockchain systems is that while they promise to be a ‘trusted’ way to do business, they have proven time and time again to be extremely vulnerable to hacking and attacks. However, the introduction of decentralized exchanges promises to help improve the trustworthiness of cryptocurrencies.<br><br>

Operating a crypto exchange is a great way for companies to make money, with fees taking from market order and market makers. This amount of money is expanded by the number of new opportunities for companies to step in and service this demand from traders and investors alike. <br><br>

The present crypto exchanges are ill-equipped to serve the ballooning demand for investors and speculators in the space of crypto. Nearly every exchange had to close their doors to new investors back in the boom of 2017. <sup class="note"><a href="#notes">4</a></sup>

Decentralized exchanges promise two major benefits: Security &amp; control and global marketplace<br>

<p>
A Decentralized exchange (DEX) enables peer-to-peer (p2p) trading of cryptocurrencies without the need for any middleman or intermediary. It is completely open source with no one party in control. Decentralized exchanges promote trustless transactions, meaning you don’t need to entrust your
cryptocurrencies to a third-party service, custodian or intermediary. You maintain full control of your account and your digital assets. With DEXs, you can say goodbye to all the stringent KYC (Know-your-client) documents necessary with the current influx of centralized exchanges. <sup class="note"><a href="#notes">5</a></sup><br><br>
Switching to decentralized exchanges is necessary for cryptocurrency users to exploit their full potential, aligning with the decentralized nature of blockchain itself. Education is arriving, and most technological hurdles we face today will probably be overcome very soon. <sup class="note"><a href="#notes">6</a></sup><br><br>
Decentralized exchanges will rise, and it won’t be too long into the future. The fact that cryptocurrencies have now become more mainstream and that many are seeing how much of an impact exchanges are having on the cryptocurrency landscape will drive the need for decentralized exchanges. With more major players having stakes in decentralized exchanges, we can expect decentralized exchanges to be less clunky and buggy and more intuitive. <sup class="note"><a href="#notes">7</a></sup><br><br>
Before this happens, there’s a serious chicken-and-egg problem that may prevent the model from challenging the established cryptocurrency exchanges. In short, you need liquidity to get adoption, yet in order to attract traders, liquidity must be given.
</p>

<p>If decentralized exchanges find a path to address this challenge, we may see the trend of transitioning to decentralized exchanges would be driven by smaller projects challenging the status quo. <sup class="note"><a href="#notes">8</a></sup><br><br>
What can decentralized exchanges do to gain increased market share? For starters, they can create platforms with easier UX – some are already doing this, eliminate technical hurdles so it’s easier for people to use, incentivize the public, promote the exchanges, deploy an array of easy to use tools and resolve scalability issues. Once all these are handled, it shouldn’t be so hard to experience massive adoption of the platforms. <sup class="note"><a href="#notes">9</a></sup><br><br>
The explosive course of cryptocurrencies and exchanges together with the challenges they face create a unique opportunity for a strong collaboration among exchanges: a community of exchanges. <br><br>
<p>
<blockquote class="quotes">
Eugene Makarenko, RubyKube.io, explains: Most of the current exchanges are fighting each for itself, meaning a no easy way to interconnect, different codebase, different KYC process and so on. With open-source, there is a way to change that and revitalize the network. The more exchanges in different countries connect with each other, the easier is the flow for the community.”

When several exchanges come together, this will create enormous economies of scale. And will multiply their power. The more the merrier.<br><br>
We, at RubyKube.io, know how to do it and can offer the right, state-of-the-art tools. RubyKube is an open-source project with over 300 contributors from all over the world besides the core team of over 60 developers who originally forked the old abandoned Peatio project on GitHub. <br><br>
